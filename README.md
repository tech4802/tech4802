## Hello ðŸ‘‹ My name is Michael and this is my GitHub presence.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use GitHub.
    - Although I have worked some with Markdown, I never had a reason to play with GitHub before.

I am a copyeditor, proofreader, and technical writer. I work primarily with technical documents but copy edit and proofread general subjects, as well.
